        I'm evaluating a candidate for a {role['title']} position.

        Job Requirements:
        {requirements_formatted}
        
        Candidate Information:
        Name: {candidate['first_name']} {candidate['last_name']}

        Today's exact date is {current_month}/{current_date.day}/{current_year}. Use this for precise experience calculations.
        
        Please evaluate this candidate with the following approach:
        
        1. Be precise in calculating years of experience:
           - For entries like "2024-Present", you must interpret this cautiously:
              * If no month is specified, assume it started in January of that year
              * For present positions, calculate duration up to today's exact date
              * Express partial years with decimal precision (e.g., 1.3 years)
           - Sum experience across ALL positions in the resume
           - Make calculations explicit (e.g., "Position A: 2.3 years, Position B: 1.5 years, Total: 3.8 years")
        
        2. Identify transferable skills:
           - Look for skills that apply to the requirements even if from different industries
           - Consider how domain knowledge from one field might transfer to this role
           - Evaluate adjacent technologies or methodologies that demonstrate relevant capabilities
        
        3. Consider depth and quality of experience:
           - Assess leadership roles and their relevance
           - Look for progression in responsibilities
           - Evaluate projects and achievements that demonstrate required capabilities
        
        Please evaluate this candidate on the following dimensions on a scale of 1-10:
        1. Technical Skills Match
        2. Experience Level
        3. Domain Knowledge
        4. Culture Fit
        5. Overall Match Percentage
        
        SCORING GUIDELINES FOR ALL DIMENSIONS:
        - 9-10: Exceptional match with direct, extensive experience/skills
          ‚Ä¢ Has direct, specific experience in this exact dimension
          ‚Ä¢ All key requirements are met or exceeded
          ‚Ä¢ If a score of 10 is warranted by the evidence and no gaps are identified, do not artificially hold back
          ‚Ä¢ A score of 9 indicates a very strong match with perhaps one minor limitation

        - 7-8: Strong match with relevant experience/skills and minor gaps
          ‚Ä¢ Has most of the required experience/skills
          ‚Ä¢ May have adjacent or transferable rather than direct experience
          ‚Ä¢ Minor gaps may exist but are offset by strengths in related areas

        - 5-6: Moderate match with partial experience/skills and notable gaps
          ‚Ä¢ Has some relevant experience/skills but lacks others
          ‚Ä¢ Experience may be limited in depth or recency
          ‚Ä¢ Transferable skills partially compensate for direct experience gaps

        - 3-4: Basic match with limited experience/skills and significant gaps
          ‚Ä¢ Limited relevant experience/skills
          ‚Ä¢ Several significant gaps exist
          ‚Ä¢ Would require substantial development in this area

        - 1-2: Poor match with minimal to no relevant experience/skills
          ‚Ä¢ Little to no relevant experience/skills
          ‚Ä¢ Critical gaps that cannot be easily overcome
          ‚Ä¢ Doesn't meet fundamental requirements

        BALANCED SCORING APPROACH:
        - Score based on the evidence, not an idealized perfect candidate
        - If you cannot identify any specific gaps or weaknesses, use the higher end of the range
        - If the candidate exceeds requirements in a dimension, this warrants a score of 10
        - Explicitly state any gaps you identify, and ensure scores reflect these gaps
        - Be willing to give scores of 10 when justified - it means "fully meets or exceeds all requirements"
        - For each score below 10, specifically explain what prevented a higher score

        For each dimension, provide:
        - The score (1-10) or (1-100) for Overall Match Percentage
        - Detailed evidence from the resume supporting this score
        - Any transferable skills or experience that contribute to this dimension
        - A calculation of years of relevant experience where applicable
